- [X] create attributed `UILabel` text by one line function `create`

### style 
- [X] fill with image, gradient or color ( `hex`, `uicolor`, `rgb` )
- [X] rounded corners for all corners or specify each corner individually

- [X] trailling to `trailing` of superview
- [X] top to `top` of superview
- [X] bottom to `bottom` of superview

- [X] leading to `trailing` of view
- [X] trailling to `leading` of view
